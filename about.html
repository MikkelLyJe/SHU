<section class="gallery"><h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <section id="about"><p>My name is Mikkel, and while I am a student at Erhversakademi Ã…rhus, I have chosen to spend my third semester abroad. <br> More specifically, I have chosen to spend it in England at Sheffield Hallam University, where I have had the courses Moving Image Project, Applied Photography as well as Web-based Media and Applications. <br>
    Even before I began studying Multimediadesign at EAAA, I was comfortable with the Adobe Package as I have studied Photography at the Media College in Viborg as well. <br>
    From this photography background I have developed my visual abilitiesthrough several years, and while my skills originates from retouching I have always been interested in visuals and design as a broader concept. <br>
    Recently I have also started branching out my fields of expertise and begun to sharpen my abilities in creating video.</p>
